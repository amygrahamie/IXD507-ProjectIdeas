## Wedding Planning App
 
## Overview

Have you ever thought how much work goes into planning a wedding?

When I got engaged, and I saw various other friends of mine get engaged. Myself and a lot of them asked the question,

#Where do I even start?

or what photographers are out there? I did a lot of research based on people I know who got married because I didn't know where to look. That is when I thought wouldn't it be perfect to plan my wedding from start to finish with the help of an app / overall wedding inspiration site. 

From working in the wedding industry for a year now designing wedding stationery, I would say my knowledge is probably better than some.. but still I was left wondering where to begin when it came to budgeting, picking a reception venue, and planning your guest list. 

Most people now have an electronic device of some sort in their lap. People used to carry diaries everywhere but now it's their phone / watch which could also be your personal assistant / wedding planner. Take away the stresses and know that the top recommended vendors are available for you to filter through to planning your perfect day. Choose filters such as Price, location, 1 or 2 photographers. 

Maybe you've got your venue, photographer etc booked elsewhere, you can still enter those details into the planning database on the app and use the app for its other functionalities like budgets etc. 

## Pros and Cons

**Pro**

* I love & work in weddings so I find this topic super interesting / fun to explore
* I'm also getting married so I see a major gap in the market for this tool to be explored further
* I have been involved in a lot of peoples weddings so I will find market research a lot easier
* The wedding industry is vastly growing and becoming more competitive so vendors could find this 
* Pinterest / instagram are widely used for inspiration. You could connect your other pages to your wedding assistant to help mood board your perfect wedding. 

**Con**

* There is a lot to consider with wedding planning and the vast amount of options available so may be complicated to prototype but I feel with the right target market / research it is possible
* I would need to learn a lot about marketing and collating content. Do people prefer to use webapps or their phones. I need to ensure I'm catering for both considering all possible platforms. Do I make it possible to plan the wedding on just the app or on a webapp also? Or just use the web as a marketing tool for the app. 
* Wedding planning isnt a simple process and can change from person to person. Can the app just be used as a source of inspiration?


## How might it be built?

iOs app, with a social media campaign and promotional website. 
I can build the prototype using Invision / Adobe XD and also learn how to use Principle for Microanimations in the app.

## Who’s it for?

* Couples who are getting married / or intending to
* Those aspiring for that 'Pinterest' wedding
* Wedding Vendors who want to use this platform to advertise their business

I think it's simple to firstly say it's for those who are intending or are getting married. I'm using myself who is 22 and those couples who are slightly older as my current target market because from my experience in weddings it has been younger couples who approach me for my work and who are wanting to achieve that perfect 'pinterest' wedding. 
I'm not ruling out the older target market, my mum and dad who are slightly older are getting married next month and from seeing their approach towards planning in comparison to mine, they don't want as much fuss but still want it to be stylish and modern. 
In conclusion I feel this planning app could cater to any bride to be who is planning their wedding.

## What’s the business model?

It's a free to use wedding planning app. You can pay to use additional features (exclusive discounts / wedding groupon page full of competitions etc)

Vendors pay to sign up to advertise their business for 6 months. If they pay for the year, they get 3 months free. 

I would need to do more research into how much businesses would be willing to pay to put their business on a well established app.) Due to there being lots of social platforms you can advertise for free, there may be a better way to make money.

Another option is I make a commission when a bride books one of the vendors on the app similar to advertising your work in a shop.
