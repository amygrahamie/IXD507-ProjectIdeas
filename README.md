## Wedding Planning App
 
## Overview

Have you ever thought how much work goes into planning a wedding?

When I got engaged, and I saw various other friends of mine get engaged. Myself and a lot of them asked the question,

### Where do I even start?

That is when I thought wouldn't it be perfect to plan my wedding from start to finish with the help of an app / overall wedding inspiration site. 

From working in the wedding industry for a year now designing wedding stationery, I would say my knowledge is probably better than some.. but still I was left wondering where to begin when it came to budgeting, picking a reception venue, and planning your guest list. 

Most people now have an electronic device of some sort in their lap. People used to carry diaries everywhere but now it's their phone / watch which could also be your personal assistant / wedding planner. Take away the stresses and know that the top recommended vendors are available for you to filter through to planning your perfect day. Choose filters such as Price, location, 1 or 2 photographers. 

Maybe you've got your venue, photographer etc booked elsewhere, you can still enter those details into the planning database on the app and use the app for its other functionalities like budgets etc. 

## Pros and Cons

**Pro**

* I love & work in weddings so I find this topic super interesting / fun to explore
* I have a good knowledge of designing for UI and UX after my placement year. I could also create a website to promote this as I have sufficient skills in HTML and CSS.
* I'm also getting married so I see a major gap in the market for this tool to be explored further
* I have been involved in a lot of peoples weddings so I will find market research a lot easier
* The wedding industry is vastly growing and becoming more competitive so vendors could find this beneficial in growing their business
* Pinterest / instagram are widely used for inspiration. You could connect your other pages to your wedding assistant to help mood board your perfect wedding. 

**Con**

* There is a lot to consider with wedding planning and the vast amount of options available so may be complicated to prototype but I feel with the right target market / research it is possible
* I would need to learn a lot about marketing and collating content. Do people prefer to use webapps or their phones. I need to ensure I'm catering for both considering all possible platforms. Do I make it possible to plan the wedding on just the app or on a webapp also? Or just use the web as a marketing tool for the app. 
* Wedding planning isnt a simple process and can change from person to person. Can the app just be used as a source of inspiration / different use cases?


## How might it be built?

iOs app, with a social media campaign and promotional website. 
I can build the prototype using Invision / Adobe XD and also learn how to use Principle for Microanimations in the app.

## Who’s it for?

* Couples who are getting married / or intending to
* Those aspiring for that 'Pinterest' wedding
* Wedding Vendors who want to use this platform to advertise their business

I think it's simple to firstly say it's for those who are intending or are getting married. I'm using myself who is 22 and those couples who are slightly older as my current target market because from my experience in weddings it has been younger couples who approach me for my work and who are wanting to achieve that perfect 'pinterest' wedding. 
I'm not ruling out the older target market, my mum and dad who are slightly older are getting married next month and from seeing their approach towards planning in comparison to mine, they don't want as much fuss but still want it to be stylish and modern. 
In conclusion I feel this planning app could cater to any bride to be who is planning their wedding.

## What’s the business model?

It's a free to use wedding planning app. You can pay to use additional features (exclusive discounts / wedding groupon page full of competitions etc)

Vendors pay to sign up to advertise their business for 6 months. If they pay for the year, they get 3 months free. 

I would need to do more research into how much businesses would be willing to pay to put their business on a well established app.) Due to there being lots of social platforms you can advertise for free, there may be a better way to make money.

Another option is I make a commission when a bride books one of the vendors on the app similar to advertising your work in a shop.

## Pill Assistance App
 
## Overview

There are so many illnesses out there that require countless medication, 3 or more times a day. Some pharmacies give booster packs that last the week but theres no system to remind you to take them at the right time or keep track if your dosage has changed. 

'Pillassistance' would be a great way for a DR to keep up to date with their patients. With a pill database that Dr's can input the correct pills and their dosage into your system and the frequency you take them. This can be updated regularly by your Dr ensuring you are always taking the correct medication. This also reminds you to take your pills and the correct times and has reward notifications once you've checked in that you've taken them. As this data is collated you are seamlessly creating a history of your medication which can be passed along easily if you move DR. 

My dad has MS and I see him trying to organise his countless medications every day, 3 times a day. Most illnesses also have an effect on the memory so a PillAssistance is like a friend in your pocket to keep you on track with your medication. You could also write notes along the way if you feel bad side effects after taking certain medications. This could be extremely helpful for your DR leading upto your next appointment. 

This could also work with the likes of the apple watch / alexa. 

## Pros and Cons

**Pro**

* This would be an incredibly helpful solution for people with who take (lots of) medication
* I have a little knowledge of the first hand problems with people dealing with medication (dad, granny etc)
* I have friends who are pharmacies / Dr's / take a lot of with medication, so finding people to interview will be easy.
* Theres a lot of scope for designing for designing for different platforms.
* There may be a gap in the market for this in the NHS for Dr's keeping up to date with how their patients are doing on a daily basis. It may even cut down on their paper work / paper trail therefore helping the environment


**Con**

* I’ll need to learn how to build a database to power everything
* I've no experience myself with medication etc so would have to do a lot of user testing / research on medication
* People would require training on how to use the app properly. Elderly people may struggle if not used to using any form of technology.
* Could add as an extra work load for Dr's / Data protection issues.
* This could become quite complicated due to the amount of disabilities so you'd have to make sure you have a solid system in place that then could be personalised for more complicated disabilities. 


## How might it be built?

An ios app for iphone / ipad. I feel it would best on iOS as its intuitive and versatile over multiple applications. DR's could operate using the ipads and clients use their phones as their systems are tailored for slightly different needs.
I’ve never built an app before so this would be a HUGE challenge for me. This would also go hand in hand with the apple watch and getting notifications and reminders to your wrist.



## Who’s it for?

* Those who take a lot of medication every day
* People with poor memory and need reminders (even if its just one pill a day)

This is quite a large target market but I feel like theres a strong niche in the market for something like this.


## What’s the business model?

I'm not confident it's something users would pay to use as they may disagree that their memory isn't great or they can keep track of everything so perhaps it would be a NHS provided app / free to download for all their patients. You would have a secure log in to access all your information.

## Behaviour Tracking in Schools
 
## Overview

Department for Education (DfE) statistics published last year show there are more than 1.3 million children in England - 15% of pupils - identified as having special educational needs. Of these pupils, 1.1 million are in mainstream schools rather than special schools. These children are being left behind and aren't receiving the appropriate amount of support and guidance. 

This isn't down to teachers neglegance but to a lack of funding for more staff. With these figures could it be proved that there is an urgency for a behavioural tracking / learning app to help build a consistency of learning for these kids who may fall behind in class by getting the parents on board with their learning and maintaining a consistency of how a child is disciplined.

This app could help teachers track the behaviour of children who have difficulities in class. All homeworks and tasks will also be logged in the app so parents are aware of the kids workload and grades. This keeps an honest communication open between parent and teacher. Keeps track of positive reinforcement and allows for parents and teachers to be onboard with how to positivitly impact the behaviour of their child across all environments.


## Pros and Cons

**Pro**

* Schools are now working with ipads in their lessons, so the hardware is already there and available to use.
* This could help identify if a child has a learning disability and keep parents more up to date with their kids learning
* Theres not enough budget currently for providing for a class room assistance for each kid who is struggling in class so this would be help provide a solution to help teachers and parents work together to track behavioural changes in particular kids. 

**Con**

* I don't have any experience working with disabled kids & their needs so would have a lot of research to carry out
* This may not be the correct solution and could end up being more work for teachers on top of the current workload.
* Parent's may not be able to afford to buy an ipad to keep updated with their kids learning so this may mean exploring another method of being informed i.e a website
* For user testing you would have to have ethical approval because you're working with people under the age of under 18. This could be overcome with initial testing with teachers and parents. 
* GDPR compliance and storing data of children under 18


## How might it be built?

I'm initally thinking an app or elearning software. I would be interested in doing more research in schools and finding out what software they use on their ipads and what they find useful and whether this could be tied in somewhere. 

I would also build a website using HTML / CSS where parents are therefore informed on their kids profile and day to day activity in the classroom.


## Who’s it for?

* Teachers who are providing care for kids with special needs / behavioural difficulties (particularly in mainstream schools)
* Parents of kid's with special needs



## What’s the business model?

With more market research and getting a sense urgency for something like this in schools, there could be potential for government funding as this would help limit the amount of resources and money trying to provide an abundance of classroom asisstants in schools.
