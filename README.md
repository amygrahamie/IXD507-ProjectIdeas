## Title: /* Spoilt for Choice (Working Title) */




## Research Question: /* Where do we as designers stand in a world full of Choice? */




## Introduction

From what to wear to what house to buy, our life is structured based on the decisions we make.  A study by Sahakian and Labuzetta found that the average person makes around 35,000 decisions a day, so it isn’t surprising that the cognitive processes surrounding decision making, particularly when it is involved in a consumer - product scenario, fascinates me. The next logical question to ask once you have began considering your/others decisions, is why. In my essay I’m going to delve into the decision making process, the effect choice has on our decision making, the pros and cons of choice, the effect choice has on not just consumers but also designers and finally how us, as designers can learn from the psychology of choice and positively impact the decision making process of our target audiences.




## Section 1: /* The Fundamentals of Decision Making */

**When making decisions, we form our opinions and thoughts using mental processes and cognitive shortcuts which are influenced by biases, reason, emotions and memories. However it is important to remember that the notion of decision making is based on the idea that we have free will. Barry Schwartz’s in his book ‘The Paradox of Choice' discusses the importance of having control over the decisions we make and the need for people to feel that society lends itself to exercising free will and autonomy. However, even when we make a conscious effort to make a decision based on a formally rational process, we tend to fall into a way of simplifying assumptions, accepting a lack of information and reducing the effort to thoroughly analyse our options. Research by Saaty clearly shows that we consistently use heuristics as a way of reducing the complexity of the process of decision making and I aim to take a fresh perspective on the psychological literature available and look into how the information available can contribute to designers approach in making successful products. 

From there it is only appropriate to begin to look into the main component of decision making - the element of choice. This is a fundamental element of the process because as soon as you remove the availability of more than one product or the opportunity to pick between two or more situations, the opportunity to make a decision is also removed. Even from this brief synopsis of the role of choice, it is pretty obvious the role choice has in this process and its benefits, especially when consider that, technically, choice provides us with free will. I know a staggering thought. For me though, as a designer, I want to know when, if ever, this relationship between decision making and choice plateaus.**



## Section 2: /* Less is More */

**Moving on from the decision making process, I want to focus more on the effect of choice and the specific effects choice has on the process of decision making and if the saying “less is more” actually holds any weight. Continuing on looking at the role of choice from a psychological perspective, a study by psychologists Sheena Lyengar and Mark Lepper from Columbia and Stanford University published compelling research specifically associated with consumer choice. Their experiment involved displaying 24 different types of jam jars on a table at a local food market followed by displaying only 6 jam jars the  following day. They recorded interested at both tables and compared data. Results showed that 60% of people were more likely to stop at the table of 24 jams but only 3% purchased anything in comparison to the table of 6 jams were only 40% of people were likely to stop but 30% of them purchased. The study shows that while choice seems appealing, choice overload can generate the wrong results. Furthermore, a study conducted by the same psychologists also found that students reported higher levels of satisfaction and wrote better essays when the option of titles was limited. I want to expand on this and further investigate the effect of too much choice. I also want to come from the viewpoint of a designer and consider this idea of choice in context to the industry and the specific effects it has on creativity, marketing and success. 
 **




## Section 3: /* Decisions in Design */

**Taking all of the above into consideration, I’d like to figure out where this idea of choice stands in our industry and how we go about using the psychological theories and findings to our advantage. Interestingly, I am not the first to be fascinated by this. Psychologists William Hick and Ray Hyman were one of the first to investigate the effect choice has on reaction time. As basic and unrelated as it sounds, from this Hick’s Law was developed and has evolved into a popular theory, influencing design decisions on a global scale. Hick’s Law will have even determined the number of controls on your microwave or your washing machine. I want to delve into how we as designers can fully understand the role Hick’s Law has to play on our design strategy and how we can add to it in a way which serves our goals and encourages exponential growth of a product in an ever growing realm of choice. **




### Conclusion

Hitting the wall of creativity is something every designer has faced. However, it is becoming more and more frequent as the pressure to produce original, unique designs is continually increasing. From a personal perspective, I have always put this down to industry overcrowding. Their are so many different varieties of apps and websites, that many areas, such as online retail, is exhausted by choice. It was really this that got me thinking about the cognitive processes involved in decision making and the effect choice has on it. I feel that by approaching the psychological literature from a designers perspective, it will hopefully inspire new ways to entice and help customers make decisions and ultimately go with your product.

+ Schwartz, B., 2004. The paradox of choice.

This book by Barry Schwartz is full of goodness and great examples of times where we are overwhelmed by Choice. He discusses the 'Less is more' concept and argues that eliminating consumer choices can greatly reduce anxiety. This will form a huge basis of my essay.

I've chosen this book because it asks the questions about how and why we choose. Is our choices defined by culture? Sheena Iyengar has award winning research in this book so there is lots of critical information that will help towards my essay.

Hick's Law relates my essay back to design and the theory he has developed around response time in design when presented with too many choices

This article will help build an argument towards my essay title as it talks about designing for better choices, what is the reason behind our design decisions and our role as a designer for a practicing for a better designed future.
